                        <h3>Aspiring Web Developer</h3>
                        <p>Hello, my name is Braydon Swanson and I am currently enrolled in BCIT studies learning Web Design and Development. I have a passion for building ever since I was a child playing with Lego.
                        My goals are to be a successful Web Developer and one day work for myself.</p>
                        <h3>Web Projects You Have Worked On:</h3>
                     	<p>I have worked on a number of web pages since starting at BCIT, you can see my progression of skill through each site.</p>
                     	<ul class="about_me_list">
                     		<li><a href="#">COMP 1950 Intro Page</a></li>

                        <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
                        <p>I believe in simple is always better, I try and take a minimilistic approach to all my designs. As a user myself I'm mainly interested in the content and not so much flashy details that distract me.</p>

                        <p>Create a homepage to serve as the hub for all your work in COMP1950. As subsequent homework assignments are issued, you will add links to them on this page. Your homepage should state your full name, or nickname if you prefer. Include some biographical information about yourself (such as from your introduction today) and a photo.</p>

                        <p>Build an HTML5 page that describes two or more places you have lived or visited other than Vancouver BC (cities, countries, any locales of your choice). Include text and images to inform the user about each place. At minimum, use one image and several sentences to describe each place. You may use images that you find online, but the textual content should be authored by you. Describe what you liked or did not like about the place, and some useful or interesting information you know (eg: where your favorite restaurant is).</p>

                        <p>You will need to partner and coordinate with another COMP1950 student to complete this lab.</p>
						<p>Create an alternate stylesheet for the homework # 1 homepage of your partner. Since you wonâ€™t have access to their FTP credentials, you will need to have them provide you with a copy of all relevant files (html, css, images, etc). Once you have created your new stylesheet send your partner a copy (and any other relevant files such as background images your CSS uses).</p>

Learn how to use it, and deploy it in this page. Demonstrate attempts to alter the style or behavior of the plugin to suit your design (change the color, sizes, speed of animation, etc).</p>

Include the use of text, hyperlinks and images. The content of one of the three posts must include a list of what parts of the theme you changed.

                        <p>Using production methods and development techniques from throughout this course, your group will create a proto-site and documents to support the redesign of the COMP1950 web site. The COMP 1950 owner would like the web site redesigned in order to better meet the needs of students. The website owner has contracted your group, as students of the class, to act as contractors for this project.</p>
						<p>Students must have easy access to notes, examples and other information. The site should reflect the aims of the course: Standards compliant web development, CSS, HTML 5, Methodology-driven design, etc.</p>
						<p>Think outside the box - don't just copy the current design. Look around at other sites and use your creativity. But - be realistic! Make your suggestions something that can work. If you have questions that will further refine your own direction, ask the owner of the site for details. Think about this project in context of the Methodology discussion of session 10.</p>
						<p>All of this should be presented in an HTML 5 compliant web site with CSS. The layout must handle well in desktop and laptop modern browsers with varying widths and heights. It does not neccessarily have to be optimized for handheld devices, unless your group decides this would be a useful feature.</p>
						<p>Your client (instructor) has filled out a project questionnaire (link below) to better clarify what they are looking for.</p>
