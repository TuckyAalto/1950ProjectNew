                        <h3>HTML Created</h3>
                        <p>HTML was created in late 1991, by Tim Berners-Lee who released the first iteration of what would become HTML 2.0 (There was no real 1.0). HTML was a langyage created during the
                        dawn of the web, using SGML as a template. Over the decade various improvments were made. The latest version 4.01 was release in December 1999. Most developers at the time were just
                        as new as everyone else, thus everyone had to learn as they went along. Because of this lots of early sites were poorly developed.</p>

                        <p>Despite it's reputation as a loose language, HTML 4.01 can be written strict like XHTML ot HTML5. The problem with HTML 4.01 wasn't the language or the authors, but more with the browsers.
                        Browser manufacturers created User Agents to help read, interpret, and fix any mistakes the make pages readable. Because of this lots of coders started exploiting problems in browsers and
                        creating pages that broke the new specs or updated User Agents. This led to a web filled with Tag Soup, or sloppy written code, which makes pages hard to index. A better solution was needed.</p>

                        <p>After years of HTML development, 4.01 became the final version to be released. Developers took a look at XML and liked what they saw, strict rules for valid markup. They thought why not take the ruleset
                        from XML and apply it to HTML? XHTML didn't instantly fix everything, but fixes were suggested by the specificication, but most browsers would now be able to render the pages. 1 major problem of XHTML though
                        was that any error would cause the browser to cease rendering. This was caused by the very strict ruleset that developers implemnted without thinking too much of what would actually happen.</p>

                        <p>Between the years of 2002-2006 a significant amount of work was attempted on XHTML2. An early decision was made to abandon backward compatibility with XHTML1 and HTML4.x leading to huge controversy.
                        Well what does that mean? Well it means older deprecated tags would no longer work, all "old" code would have to be updated, and browsers would have even more work to do rendering pages. Other changes included:
                        Forms would now be controlled by XForms, a new system that allows for error checking. DOM events would be replaced with XML Events - which required very strict coding standards. Lists for navigation would be created
                        with new n1 tags. And any element would have href or src attributes. A vote was called upon whether to implement these new standards, but was ultimatly struck down.</p>

                        <h3>Arising out of the morass</h3>
                        <p>HTML5 was born out of the frustration with XHTML2 development. By the end of 2005 there was little movement with XHTML, with the development bogged down with problems and solving those problems.
                          There were two distinct camps for a new language: Strict and Non Strict. After a series of decisions against a more forgiving, backward compatible version, a number of HTML Working Group members created their own group: WHATWG
                          After 3 years, Web Applications 1.0 gained considerable momentum when Mozilla, Apple and Opera joined the Working Group and requested that it become part of the W3C's HTML Working Group
                          In 2007, the W3C HTML working group adopted the development, renamed it HTML5 (a successor to HTML 4.01) and released a Public Working Draft in 2008. As of October 28, 2014, HTML5 is the offical W3C recommendation.
                          Browsers are now expected to fully support HTML5 in any new browsers or updates they do.</p>

                        <h3>Is it time to start using HTML5?</h3>
                        <p>Simply answer is yes, and no. Try the <a href="#">HTML5Test.</a> Compare all the web browsers to get a better idea of what elements are supported on which browser. One of the great things about HTML5 is the ability to use
                        tags from previous HTML interations, tags are therefore interpreted and rendered correctly. What happens when you use an unknown element... say: My Dog. If the browser is Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera: inline style.
                        If the browser is IE: no style at all, all child elements are treated as siblings instead. One browser which might make working with HTML5 difficult is IE, however there are a few work arounds. The biggest one being a string of
                        code called a shiv, which is inserted into the head section. The shiv works for browsers that are IE 8 or less, which will allow you to use HTML5 elements even though they may not be supported in that browser.</p>

                        <p>A CSS rule defines what the HTML should look like and how it should behave in the browser window. Parts of a CSS rule are: selector {property: value;} = rule. selector - can be HTML, class, or ID.
                          {property: value;} = declaration. Properties identify what is bring defined: font-family, font-weight, font-size, color, etc. Values are assigned to define the nature of the property: verdana, bold, 16px, green, etc.
                          There are 3 ways to apply CSS rules: HTML selector, class, or an ID. Rules are setup in one of three places: in an HTML tag, in the head of a document, or in an external stylesheet. The best and most
                          common way is using an external stylesheet, linking to one uses a simple link tag that looks like: < link rel="stylesheet" href="filename.css" >. rel defines the link, href is the pathfile to the stylesheet.</p>

                        <p>Web pages can be written in HTML5 today, even if not all clients are ready for it. Just be sure to follow best practices to ensure forward and backward compatibility. When using HTML5: create more semantic
                        documents by using HTML5 tags such as header, footer, etc. Use <a href="#">HTML5Test.</a> with several browsers to determine what HTML5 is currently supported. Apply the HTML5 Shiv to ensure IE browsers will
                        recognize and style new HTML5 tags. CSS Fundamentals, be sure you are comfortable with the fundamentals of CSS: how to apply CSS inline, embedded, and externally. how write CSS rules: selector { property:value; }.

                              textual content should be authored by you. Describe what you liked or did not like
                              about the place, and some useful or interesting information you know (eg: where your
